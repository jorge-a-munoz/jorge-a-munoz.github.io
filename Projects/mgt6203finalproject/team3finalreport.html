States</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c8 c28 c29">Section 1: Background Information</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8">Background: </span><span class="c21">The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) collects information from state and local health departments on outbreaks of foodborne illnesses across the United States, and uses this information to not only track outbreaks, but also to inform regulatory agencies and consumer groups on how they may introduce additional prevention measures to improve food safety. When instances of foodborne illnesses are made through official means, the CDC collects an array of data such as the location type the illness originated from, the specific species an individual was infected with or foods consumed before developing an illness. However, in recent years the number of food poisoning cases reported unofficially through social media platforms such as Yelp and Twitter have increased, as reported in a 2018 study conducted by the Journal for Medical Internet Research (</span><span class="c11">Oldroyd, 2018)</span><span class="c21">. The CDC has responded to this shift by applying advanced methods in web scraping and natural language processing to ensure they are capturing reports of foodborne illness regardless of reporting method. Data containing reports made through official channels is available to the public on the CDC&rsquo;s website, and was the basis of analytical investigation for this project.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8">Problem Statement: </span><span class="c0">The purpose of this project was to create a collection of models that collectively may be used to trace foodborne illness outbreaks to specific ingredients, and also to find correlations between certain locations or times of year and specific pathogens. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8">Primary Research Question (RQ): </span><span class="c0">Can outbreaks of foodborne pathogens and the source of that outbreak be accurately identified using patient reports and common food ingredients data?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">Supporting Research Questions: </span></p><ol class="c36 lst-kix_list_1-0 start" start="1"><li class="c34 c44 c43 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Is the source of the illness among the reported items or is it a food commonly served with an ingredient of the reported items?</span></li><li class="c34 c44 c43 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Is there a correlation between time of year and incidences of foodborne illness, or even incidences of certain pathogens?</span></li><li class="c34 c43 c44 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Are certain foods or locations particularly susceptible to contamination, especially by certain pathogens?</span></li><li class="c1 c43 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">For cases where a species was not reported, what are the estimates of which species was likely the cause of the illness? </span></li></ol><p class="c1"><span class="c8">Business Justification:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;With outbreaks of foodborne illness it can be difficult to pinpoint the origin of the illness, causing delays in recalls or advisories. Some illnesses are not only inconvenient, but possibly even deadly to groups such as children, the elderly, the immunocompromised or pregnant women. Even treatable and milder foodborne illnesses can put a strain on the healthcare system when large outbreaks occur. Catching outbreaks early and identifying the culprit can be crucial in preventing further spreading of the outbreak and also in ensuring that the business, restaurant, or corporation responsible for the contamination tests their food supply more stringently to prevent future contamination. &nbsp;However, one of the difficulties in accurately identifying the source of contamination is imprecision. The patient may be able to report which meal made them ill, but would not be able to identify which component of the meal it was that carried the pathogen. Leveraging a database of ingredients for various recipes, health officials may be able to identify common foods and common ingredients in cases with the same illness-causing species and reported symptoms. </span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c29 c8 c28">Section 2: Data Sources and Data Cleaning Process</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8">Data Source Links:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Recipe Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shuyangli94/food-com-recipes-and-user-interactions</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Foodborne Disease Outbreaks: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cdc/foodborne-diseases</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8">Data Descriptions: </span><span class="c21">Recipes Dataset - This dataset provides a list of over 290K unique recipes and their list of ingredients sourced from </span><span class="c21 c25">Food.com</span><span class="c0">.

Contaminant source was the dependent variable of this model. The food variable was used to populate the ingredient lists variable, using the recipe data. The team&rsquo;s initial hypothesis was that ingredients list, location, month/year and species would be most important in finding outbreaks. However, it is important to note that parts of the team&rsquo;s approach resembled clustering rather than a supervised algorithm when it comes to detecting outbreaks, so the dependent variable for these cases was the &lsquo;outbreak&rsquo; or cluster that the data point is assigned to.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8">Recipes Data Cleaning</span><span class="c21 c25">:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;The initial data cleaning required for the Recipes dataset was minimal, as only the ingredient string needed to be scrubbed of additional punctuation and spaces before used to conduct a probabilistic analysis of which ingredients were most likely to appear in a certain recipe type. Once the ingredient string was cleaned, the list of ingredients was separated into individual rows to easily determine the probability of an ingredient being in the recipe type. Additionally, names of recipes contained within the data set were simplified by removing any additional adjectives or descriptors in the recipe title. This was done by creating a list of foods based on the CDC dataset, and then using string matching to find the names from the food list in the recipe names. All unnecessary columns were then removed from the Recipes data, with the cleaned data only having the following columns: Name, Recipe ID, and Ingredient.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8">CDC Data Cleaning</span><span class="c8 c25">: </span><span class="c0">The raw CDC Foodborne Disease Outbreaks dataset, hereinafter referred to as the CDC dataset, contained over 19,000 individual observations representing cases reported to the CDC from 1998 to 2015.

These frequencies were then used to calculate the probability of an ingredient appearing in a recipe, and the final list of ingredients tied to each recipe was determined by selecting ingredients that exceed the 30% threshold for probability of appearing in a recipe. The initial threshold selected was 50%, however for many recipes this resulted in short lists with very few ingredients due to large variation in recipes, so this threshold was reduced to 30%. Considering the vast number of recipes considered, the team concluded that 30% likelihood was a sufficient value to deem an ingredient as likely to occur in a particular recipe. Furthermore, the same ingredient may have been referred to by different names based on brand or region of the recipe, so the probability of a recipe containing an ingredient can be considered a modest estimate for most ingredients. This final list was used to populate the &ldquo;food&rdquo; column in the cleaned CDC dataset. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8">Exploratory Data Analysis of CDC Data</span><span class="c21">:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;After data cleaning, the team conducted an initial analysis of the CDC data to gain insights on foodborne illness trends and stats on the most commonly reported species, foods, locations and states within the data.

The team also applied a Random Forest algorithm to classify cases based on illness-causing species. Once constructed, model performance was compared through cross-validation of the KNN model and Random Forest model using the portion of reported cases attributed to an identified species. This subset of data was broken out into a 70/15/15 percent split to perform training, validation and testing. Performance of each model was determined based on their effectiveness in classifying points. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Development and selection of these initial models targeted identification of a particular illness-causing species, but to gain additional insights regarding foodborne illness the team also applied an exponential smoothing model to investigate correlations between the season and spikes in illnesses caused by particular species.

This model was used to determine the probability of an accurate species classification. The data was divided into train and test data, with 70% used for train and the remaining 30% used for testing. For model creation, LOOCV (Leave One Out Cross Validation), was used to identify the optimal kernel and k-value. An initial model was built to determine the probability of correctly identifying a species based on only the Food and Ingredients. A secondary model was built using Month, State, Location, Food, and Ingredients to identify whether these factors improve the probability of correctly identifying a species. A summary of each model is shown in the table below. </span></p><a id="t.3a927c20d7c36168c0c04f520b97ca926b129df7"></a><a id="t.1"></a><table class="c23"><tr class="c26"><td class="c10" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c9"><span class="c4">Model</span></p></td><td class="c31" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c9"><span class="c29 c21 c30">Model 1: Species ~ Food+Ingredient</span></p></td><td class="c17" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c9"><span class="c29 c21 c30">Model 2: Species ~ Month+ State+Location+Food+Ingredient</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c7"><td class="c10" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c9"><span class="c6">k-value / Kernel</span></p></td><td class="c31" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c9"><span class="c29 c21 c30">k-value: 7, Kernel: Optimal</span></p></td><td class="c17" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c9"><span class="c29 c21 c30">k-value: 47, Kernel: Optimal</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c7"><td class="c10" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c9"><span class="c6">Train Accuracy</span></p></td><td class="c31" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c9"><span class="c29 c21 c30">30.09%</span></p></td><td class="c17" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c9"><span class="c29 c21 c30">33.40%</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c7"><td class="c10" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c9"><span class="c6">Test Accuracy</span></p></td><td class="c31" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c9"><span class="c29 c21 c30">24.91%</span></p></td><td class="c17" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c9"><span class="c29 c21 c30">29.47%</span></p></td></tr></table><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As seen above, the initial model performed worse than Model 2, indicating there is a relationship between the Month, State, and Location, in addition to the Foods and Ingredients, for the suspected species.

In addition to the initial observation of Model 2 performing better than Model 1, the overall prediction probabilities are very low, with only 29.47% accuracy from the test dataset in Model 2, indicating this model can not be used to accurately identify the species in cases where the pathogen was not reported. In order to accurately predict the species, it appears more data would need to be collected and included in the model. An example of data that has the potential to increase this model&rsquo;s performance in predicting an unknown pathogen species would be &lsquo;Reported Symptoms,&rsquo; as different pathogens can present unique sets of symptoms once consumed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8">Development of Random Forest Classification Model:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Due to the large number of categorical variables and number of categories within each variable, the CDC dataset becomes highly-dimensional when converting all categorical variables to factor variables. A random forest classification model was developed to leverage the algorithm&rsquo;s ability to implicitly handle multicollinearity in features - a common problem when working with high-dimensional data. The data was preprocessed by dropping unnecessary columns, and converting all categorical variables in factor variables. The data was then divided into train and test data, with 70% used for train and the remaining 30% used for testing. The random forest model was applied to each dataset to generate predictions of Species based on the year, month, state, location, food, and ingredients consumed. The model yielded the results captured in the summary table below. </span></p><a id="t.9b146e686482494efcf097ae103a35680c63d024"></a><a id="t.2"></a><table class="c35"><tr class="c26"><td class="c18" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c9"><span class="c4">Model</span></p></td><td class="c3" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c9"><span class="c29 c21 c30">Random Forest Model: Species ~ Year + Month + State + Location + Food + Ingredient</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c7"><td class="c18" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c9"><span class="c6">Train Accuracy</span></p></td><td class="c3" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c9"><span class="c29 c21 c30">51.8%</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c7"><td class="c18" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c9"><span class="c6">Test Accuracy</span></p></td><td class="c3" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c9"><span class="c29 c21 c30">43.6%</span></p></td></tr></table><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Compared to the KNN model, the random forest model produced higher performance accuracy with both train and test data sets. However, with a 43.6% model accuracy when applied to test data, the team did not feel confident this model is accurate enough to produce reliable predictions of the correct species. The following discussion addresses the importance of each variable in increasing accuracy of the model.</span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 1.33px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 479.91px; height: 352.12px;"><img alt="" src="images/image8.png" style="width: 479.91px; height: 352.12px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c24"><span class="c0">The mean decrease Gini plot shown to the right provides the mean decrease in Gini coefficient, which is a measure of how each variable contributes to the homogeneity of the nodes and leaves in the random forest that was trained. The higher the value of the mean decrease Gini score, the greater the importance of the variable in the model.</span></p><p class="c24"><span class="c0">For the random forest model, the variable &lsquo;year&rsquo; is the clear winner in terms of importance. This could imply that the target variable has a strong temporal pattern or trends that are associated with different years. However, there are some things to note about the dataset used to train this model. The dataset has an imbalanced distribution across the &lsquo;year&rsquo; variable. It is the most prevalent within the dataset, as the variable only has 17 unique years, or classes. Meanwhile, the rest of the variables have a significantly lower prevalence since they have been factored to store the hundreds of classes stored within. This imbalance could result in the model having a bias towards the classes with higher prevalence &ndash; in this case, the &lsquo;year&rsquo; variable &ndash; and lead to a high importance score for those classes.</span></p><p class="c24"><span class="c0">Secondly, and perhaps most importantly, is that the imbalance of the CDC dataset could have a significant effect on the accuracy of the model. More specifically, the imbalance of the food and ingredient variables, since these variables contain the highest number of classes by a significant margin. If one food or ingredient class (minority class) has significantly fewer samples than another food or ingredient class (majority class), the model will be biased towards the majority class. As a result, the minority class is poorly represented in the training set.</span></p><p class="c24"><span class="c21">Outside of increasing the amount of data collected, several strategies can be used in future iterations to mitigate the impact of this imbalance on the accuracy of the model. Oversampling the minority class or undersampling the majority class can balance the class distribution in the training set, providing equal opportunities for the model to learn from all classes. Ensemble techniques could be employed that are designed for imbalance data, such as a random balanced forest, which adapts the random forest algorithm to better handle imbalanced class distributions.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8">Development and Output of Exponential Smoothing Model:</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c21">In addition to the KNN and random forest models discussed above, the team also developed an exponential smoothing model to investigate the presence of cyclical or seasonal trends in the data set.

The columns of interest, illness count and date, were aggregated and put into a Holt-Winters smoothing function. Graphical output of this model is shown to the right. The model yielded gamma and beta values above zero, indicating there is a degree of both seasonality and cyclical effects in time-series data of the number of reported foodborne illnesses and also confirms that month indeed has a correlation to number of incidences. &nbsp;Further inspecting model output, it appears that the highest peaks all occur in the December-January period. Contrary to the team&rsquo;s initial expectations, summer does not see drastic increases in foodborne illness occurrences due to warmer environments and transportation temperatures. However, the December-January peaks support the idea that the holiday season, which sees large incidences of gatherings and shared meals during Christmas and New Years, is a time of increased likelihood of foodborne illness. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c21">To further inspect trends in the data and investigate possible causes, the team compared the time-series plots showing number of outbreaks attributed to six different species over the time frame captured by CDC data: </span><span class="c21 c37 c46">Scombroid toxin, Salmonella enterica, Virus, Clostridium perfringens, Norovirus genogroup I, Staphylococcus aureus. Scombroid toxin outbreaks significantly drop off after 2005, and do not peak after that. This drop may be related to the 2006 Seafood import monitoring program, as Scombroid poisoning is primarily caused by fish. Salmonella, as initially expected, peaks both in July and December/January, which may be related to 4th of July and Christmas festivities. Both Clostridium and Norovirus show peaks in July and Christmas. Additionally, they both have a significant drop in occurrence starting in 2007, possibly due to a change in the industry or regulations of certain foods. This drop is also visible in the Holt-Winters plot above, with peaks becoming less tall and sharp, but is less prominent than in the individual species plots. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8">Analysis of </span><span class="c6">Corollary Relationships Among Species Type and Categorical Variables: </span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 460.12px; height: 341.98px;"><img alt="" src="images/image1.png" style="width: 460.12px; height: 341.98px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c21">The team constructed several correlation matrices between Species and other categorical variables of interest to identify correlations among factors within the CDC data. Initial matrices calculated correlation coefficients for each unique species contained within the CDC data set, but after finding that the output was rather dense and difficult to interpret given the number of variables being displayed, the team filtered the species variable down to only the top ten most commonly appearing species. Similarly, the list of states was filtered down to the top ten most commonly occurring states within the data. Filtered data for species, states and months were then used to construct correlation matrix heatmaps to investigate the existence of correlations among species/state, and among species/month. The correlation heat map for species and state, shown to the right, suggests the existence of moderate positive correlations between Staphylococcus Aureus and the state of Florida, between Norovirus and Minnesota, between Scombroid Toxin and New York, between Scombroid Toxin and Hawaii and between Ciguatoxin and Hawaii. The correlation matrix heatmap for species and months, shown to the left, suggests the existence of a semi-weak positive correlation between Salmonella and the months of June through September, indicating a peak in Salmonella cases during these months. Additionally, the species-month correlation heat map suggests a semi-weak positive correlation between Norovirus and the months of January through April, indicating a peak in Norovirus between these months. Upon comparing correlation model output on seasonal peaks of certain species with statistics on seasonal foodborne illness peaks from the CDC&rsquo;s website, the team confirmed that these are accurate conclusions and align with official trends (</span><span class="c21 c25">Information for Healthcare Professionals</span><span class="c21">).</span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 405.50px; height: 330.11px;"><img alt="" src="images/image1.png" style="width: 447.60px; height: 330.11px; margin-left: -19.76px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8">Conclusions: </span><span class="c0">The team&rsquo;s initial goal was to try to determine the source of an outbreak of foodborne illness using recipe and ingredient data. Although the team cannot decisively determine which exact food caused an outbreak or a case of illness, ingredients most likely to be consumed before illness occurs given a general category of food consumed can be identified in observations in which that data was not provided. The team has also been able to find which foods are most likely to be correlated with foodborne illnesses; seafood, milk, eggs and salads were found to be the most frequently involved. In the case of milk and eggs, although they are reported on their own and consumed independently, they more often appear in recipes. Simply looking at the people who reported milk and eggs independently would have greatly underestimated the involvement of these two foods. The recipe analysis allowed the team to draw more accurate conclusions about their prevalence in contamination and foodborne illness cases. Furthermore, both location and time of year were found to have a measurable correlation to foodborne illness. The corollary relationships matrix and the coefficients of beta and gamma from the exponential smoothing are significant enough to assume that there is a genuine correlation between these variables, rather than a coincidence or small sample size leading to overly optimistic conclusions. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c21">When it came to predicting the species involved in the illness, the classification model produced an accuracy of 29%, which led the team to conclude that this particular approach is not reliable enough to be used in predictions or diagnosis. This may in part be due to the dataset itself. The CDC data was collected with the intention of tracking foodborne illness cases and outbreaks; it was not intended to be used to create a classification model. Thus, it is reasonable that it does not contain all columns necessary, such as detailed symptoms or length of infection, to create such a model. Considering the large number of possible illnesses (well over 50) and the limited dataset, an accuracy of 29% is enough to show that the independent variables, though limited, have high correlation to the species of infection.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c8 c28">Section 4: Works Cited</span><span class="c29 c21 c28">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c11">Dewey-Mattia, Daniel et al. &ldquo;Surveillance for Foodborne Disease Outbreaks - United States, 2009-2015.&rdquo; </span><span class="c11 c25">Morbidity and mortality weekly report.
